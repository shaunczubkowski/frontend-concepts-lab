# Frontend Concepts Lab

This repository is a curated collection of **hands-on exercises, demos, and deep dives** into core front-end concepts.

It is designed both as a **learning resource** for myself and a **portfolio of practical examples** to showcase my skills to employers.

Inspired by Pooja Prabakar's [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pooja-prabakar_frontenddevelopment-interviewprep-javascript-activity-7376254089447313408-A3N5?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAChE8p4BLvAVqC1Kof_UivPHAcK29OiNiPY).

## ðŸš€ Goals

- Gain a deep understanding of important front-end topics.
- Build real demos for each concept.
- Document concepts with explanations, exercises, and sources.
- Showcase ability to implement and explain solutions.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

Each concept has its own folder containing:

- **Demo code** (`index.html`, `.js`, `.css` files).
- **README.md** explaining the concept, exercises, and sources.
