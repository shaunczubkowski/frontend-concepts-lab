        This lab is focused on event delagation; a technique where an event
        listener is attached to a parent element that handles events which
        originate from its child elements. This approach improves performance
        and simplifies code by reducing the number of event listeners needed,
        especially when dealing with dynamic content.

      <h3>Event Bubbling VS Capturing</h3>
      <p>
        Before diving into the examples, familiarize yourself with the
        difference between event bubbling and capturing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Event Bubbling:</strong> When an event occurs on an element,
          it first runs the handlers on that element, then on its parent, and so
          on up the DOM tree. This is the default behavior in most browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Event Capturing:</strong> Also known as "trickling," the event
          starts from the root of the DOM and travels down to the target
          element, triggering handlers along the way if specified.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Key Difference:</strong> Bubbling goes from the target element
          up to the root, while capturing goes from the root down to the target
          element.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Event Delegation In Action</h2>
      <p>
        In this example, we have a list of items. Instead of attaching an event
        listener to each individual item, we attach a single event listener to
        the <code>ul</code> parent element. This listener can handle events for
        all current and future list items.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to event delegation, when you add a new item to the list, it is
        automatically covered by the existing event listener on the parent
        element. You do not need to add a separate event listener for each new
        item.
